## Q1
# Answer:
  Turing came up with a total of 9 different objectives in his original paper **Computer Machinery and Intelligence**
  Perhaps the most weight is carried by the the argument about consciousness. Computers have advanced by a lot, however
  computers are yet to be truly sentient. While there are machines capable of mimicking human behavior, we cant say that
  it is much more than mimicking, the refutation also hold on this, about humans, and what if we are mimicking something as
  well, taking apart the theological aspect of the question, about the soul and religion, it could be said that we are 
  programmed as well, so this question still holds a lot of weight even in modern times. Turing's refutation implies 
  behaviourism, amongst other things, and does not fully address the situation.

 **Lady Lovelace's objection**, as outlined in Turing's paper, suggests that machines can only perform tasks for which 
  they are explicitly programmed and lack creativity or originality. She argued that machines could not originate anything, and 
  would only follow what humans told it to do. Turing refuted this idea by the process of randomness, by that he implied that 
  even we could not fully predict the outcomes of a machine. Despite Turing's refutation, Lady Lovelace's objection still holds 
  weight in discussions about AI. While modern Ai is pretty impressive and eveyrthing there is a lack of ture creativeness.

  **The Argument from Continuity in the Nervous System** Turing acknowledges the objection that the discontinuity in the function of 
  a digital computer contrasts with the continuous nature of the nervous system. Turing argued by saying that computers replicate, 
  logical functions same as out brain to a certain degree, the main issue with this thing is that the computive power to truly 
  rival brain patterns, and biological comparision still needs a lot of work.

  As for Turing's prediction that by the year 2000, a computer would have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled 
  interrogator In 1950, the capabilities of computers were relatively primitive compared to today's technology. While significant progress has 
  been made in AI, achieving human-level conversational abilities remains a formidable challenge.Even in 2024, I tired the Turing test with
  multiple ai like chat gpt, gemini, but most of them slipped up after the initial 2-3 minutes, meaning Turing was way too optimisic 
  about the entire scenario
  
  
  
## Q2
#Answer 2
  **Translating spoken English into spoken Urdu in real time**: 
    In this specific Areaq, Ai has made a lot of advances such as Google and Microsoft translator both have the capabilities to translate realtime.
    hTey are capable of providing useful translations for communication purposes in real-world scenarios. however it is important to note they are not 
    always fully accurate.

  **Playing a decent game of table tennis**
    With the help of reinforcement learning some systems are npw able to hold a decent match against human opponents, as seen with the systems Open Ai
    developed, however they are still not good enough to be considered professionals 

  **Driving in Karachi**
    While Driving has been automated to a very large degree as seen in Teslas, and other Ev's, but they are once again nott perfect, and in heavy traffic 
    humans have to take control of the vehcile in order to avoid any accident.

  **Writing an intentionally funny story**

  While LLms like chatGpt, are pretty good at writing and communicating with humans, and time to time they may come up woth something funny, but that is very 
  less, as the writing is lack luster, and pretty much written without a lot of emotion, and this is because Ai is yet to truly understand humor and sarcasm.

  **Discovering and proving new mathematical theorems**
    Computers have contributed to mathematical research by assisting in theorem proving and exploration of mathematical spaces. Automated theorem proving systems
    and computer-assisted proofs have been successful in verifying existing theorems and exploring mathematical conjectures. However, discovering entirely new 
    theorems remains primarily a human endeavor.
    
## Q3
##Domain: Dota 2 Gaming

**Description of Agent**:

Enter the strategic world of Dota 2, where teams of heroes clash in battles of skill, coordination, and strategy. In this domain, our agent serves as your 
virtual teammate and coach, offering guidance, tactical advice, and support to help you and your team secure victory in intense multiplayer matches.


**Accessible:**
The environment is accessible through the Dota 2 gaming platform, where players engage in multiplayer matches across various game modes and maps, each 
with its own objectives and challenges.
**Deterministic:** While certain game mechanics, such as hero abilities and item effects, follow consistent rules, player decisions and interactions
introduce elements of uncertainty and variability into each match.
**Episodic:** Each match in Dota 2 can be considered an episode, beginning with drafting heroes and ending with the victory or defeat of one team.
Matches are divided into discrete phases, such as laning, team fights, and pushing objectives.
**Static:** The environment remains relatively static within the context of each match, with changes occurring primarily in response to player actions, 
such as hero movement, ability usage, and strategic decisions.
**Continuous:** Interactions within the game occur in real-time, with players making split-second decisions and reacting to dynamic events as they unfold
during matches.


##Agent Architecture:


**Reactive Components:** These components enable the agent to respond rapidly to in-game events, such as enemy engagements, map control shifts, and objective
captures. The agent leverages predefined strategies, tactical analysis, and real-time game state information to make quick decisions and adapt to changing circumstances
on the battlefield.

**Deliberative Components:** In addition to reactive responses, the agent incorporates elements to facilitate long-term planning, strategic coordination, and team communication.
It employs advanced algorithms, machine learning techniques, and player behavior analysis to formulate overarching strategies, predict opponent movements, and optimize team 
tactics throughout the course of each match.

Bye using these two approaches our agent can better the experience of the players within the game.

Performance Measure: Completion of the sweater, quality of stitches, and overall aesthetics.
Environment: Knitting area with knitting needles, yarn, pattern instructions, and workspace.
Actuators: Hands and fingers for manipulating knitting needles and yarn, following the knitting pattern.
Sensors: Eyes for reading the knitting pattern, feeling the texture of the yarn and stitches, and monitoring progress.

**Exploring the subsurface of the Arabian Sea:**

Performance Measure: Depth reached, geological samples collected, marine life observed, andsafety.
Environment: Arabian Sea with varying depths, marine life, underwater terrain.

## Q5
**There exist task environments in which no pure reflex agent can behave rationally.**

True. Pure reflex agents operate based on current perceptual input without considering past experiences or future consequences. In complex environments
with non-deterministic outcomes or delayed effects, pure reflex agents may fail to behave optimally, such as a chess game.

**There exists a task environment in which every agent is rational.**

False. Rationality depends on the agent's ability to select actions that maximize its expected usage given its knowledge and beliefs about the environment.
In some task environments with uncertainty or conflicting objectives, no agent may be able to consistently make optimal decisions.
For example, in a stock market, no algorithm can actually 100% be right.

**Every agent function is implementable by some program/machine combination.**

True. An agent function defines everything, specifying how an agent should behave in response to its observations.
As long as the agent function can be expressed correctly using algos, it can be implemented by some program running on a compatible computing device. 
However, the efficiency and practicality of the implementation may vary depending on the complexity of the agent function and the capabilities of the hardware.

**An agent that senses only partial information about the state cannot be perfectly rational.**

True. In order to get perfect rationality you need to know everything about the environment without complete data the agent may make inaccurate decisions. 
For example, a self-driving car that can only detect objects in its immediate surrounding may not be able to anticipate obstacles further down the road, leading 
to potentially unsafe decisions.

**It is possible for a given agent to be perfectly rational in two distinct task environments.**

True. PErfect rationality would be the ability to make perfect decisions regardless of the environemnt, as long as the data is complete. If an agent has the necessary capabiliites,
it can indeed make rational decisions, in two distinct environments.For example, a chess-playing AI that employs the same optimal strategy regardless of the opponent's skill level
or playing style would be considered perfectly rational in all chess environments.
